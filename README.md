# Amazon-Sales-Data-Analysis-Excel 
This project showcases end-to-end data analysis skills using Microsoft Excel, focusing on cleaning, transforming, and visualizing a real-world Amazon sales dataset. The goal was to derive actionable business insights, identify top-performing products, and analyze pricing strategies.

## This analysis emphasizes the power of native Excel features for robust data manipulation and reporting:
* **Data Cleaning & Formatting:** Handling inconsistent data types (text to number), removing currency symbols (₹, %), and managing over 100 duplicate product entries.
* **Data Transformation using Formulas:** Implementing complex logical and text-based formulas to create new metric columns.
* **PivotTables & PivotCharts:** Summarizing large datasets into flexible reports and converting them into professional visualizations.
* **Dashboarding:** Creating an interactive, single-view dashboard for key performance indicators (KPIs) and visual insights.
